Project description: this program reads the text from the in.txt file, which is entered on one line, then reads out individual words 
(their number should be indicated in the second line), after which the number of sentences in which this word was encountered is output to the out.txt file,
and then the sentences themselves, where the search word is written in uppercase.
Remarks: words that differ only in the case of letters are considered the same (for example, the words Friend and Friend are considered the same)
Installation instructions: copy the code from Source.cpp file and paste into your environment supporting C++
For correct operation of the program, it is recommended to use the language standard of 2014 or newer.
